# DriverPass-Project-CS-System-Analysis-and-Design
ðŸ§­ CS 255 Portfolio Reflection â€“ DriverPass System

The DriverPass project was created for a client named Liam, who wanted a system to help students improve their DMV test pass rates. The goal was to design a secure, cloud-based platform that allows students to register, take online practice tests, schedule in-person lessons, and track their progress. The system also supports administrators, instructors, and secretaries by automating scheduling, reporting, and account managementâ€”all in one unified environment

One thing I did particularly well was translating the clientâ€™s spoken needs from the interview into specific, measurable system requirements. My Business Requirements Document clearly outlined both functional and nonfunctional requirements, such as web accessibility, security features like multi-factor authentication, and scalability for future modules. In my System Design Document, I built UML diagrams that demonstrated each process step visuallyâ€”from registration and lesson scheduling to data flow and role-based access control

If I could revise one part of my work, I would focus on refining the class diagram to show clearer relationships between entities, such as linking the instructor and vehicle tables through reservation IDs. This would make the data structure even more consistent and easier to expand in future versions.

When designing the system, I paid close attention to the user experience. Liam emphasized that the platform should be accessible on any device and simple for both students and staff. I incorporated these needs into responsive interface designs, intuitive navigation, and automated confirmations. Considering the userâ€™s needs is critical because it ensures that the system not only functions properly but also supports real-world workflows efficiently and with minimal frustration.

My general approach to software design involves breaking down the system into clear, modular components and using UML diagrams to visualize how they connect. I also apply iterative design techniques and prioritize security and scalability early in the process. In the future, I plan to continue using techniques like user stories, agile sprints, and mock-ups in Figma or Lucidchart before development begins. These tools make it easier to communicate design ideas and adapt to client feedback quickly.

Together, these documents highlight my ability to analyze a clientâ€™s goals, define requirements, and transform them into a detailed system design ready for implementation.
